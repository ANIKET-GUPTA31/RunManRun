# RunManRun
I developed a 2D game called "Run Man Run" using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, where players control a character to jump and avoid obstacles while tracking their score. Thanks to Code with Harry's YouTube tutorials, I learned game development, including animations, collision detection, and enhancing game mechanics. Excited for future projects!
